# About

#### Current Stable RomRaider Version: v1.0.0

NissanDefinitions supports ECU ROM definition files for SH7055/SH7058 Nissan and Infiniti ECU's. These definition files are formatted to be compatible with RomRaider. Vehicles with these ECU's typically includes model years between ~2001-2010. 

Each ROM has its own definition file that stores the ROM addresses for all defined tables. This definition file references the A2L template file, which contains table specific data. The ScalingData file is where all table scalars are stored. Using the "Combine All.bat" file will merge all files into one. As time goes on, more and more ROMs will be defined.
