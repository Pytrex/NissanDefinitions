# NissanDefs
Definition files for Nissan engine control computers to be used with the Rom Raider Ecu Editor.

These definiton files are considered EXPERIMENTAL and without any warranty expressed or implied.

Please be sure you understand the consequences of using definitions to edit engine control computers before using.

File names of the definition files correspond to the ECU Id of the software that they are compatible with.


# How to use

RomRaider works better if all the definition files are in a single xml file (table templates and per-ROM defines).
To ease maintenance, this repo contains definitions for each ECUID in a separate file.

The all-in-one xml file must be generated by running the included .bat file, then added from within RomRaider.
